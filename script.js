//ternary js is a simple language as you learn. 
//here i'll teach you first how we should start.

var name = "yakraj";
var reply = name == "yakraj" ? "hello" : "i don't know you man";

//same way if i'll code with if conditional syntax
var name = "yakarj";
function reply(){
if (name = "yakraj"){
return "hello";
}
else{
return "i don't know you man";
}
}

//same all the way we can make some boolians
function iwonGame(bool){
  return bool;
}
var whatDidyou = iwonGame(false) ?"Really i Won this Game" : "decent work";
var whatDidyou = iwonGame(true) ?"Really i Won this Game" : "decent work";

//ternary is the very easy way if you want to make if else condition 
//but there is another syntax if you want like if, else, if else, so you can use antoher syntax named switch this is also really useful 
//whether you can check there on my github account https://github.com/yakraj/
